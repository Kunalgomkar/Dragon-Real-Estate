# Dragon Real Estate – House Price Prediction

## Description
This project is focused on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques.  
It covers the complete data science process including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately estimate property prices based on input features.

---

## Problem Statement
Real estate prices depend on multiple factors such as location, number of rooms, population, and infrastructure.  
This project uses historical data to learn these patterns and predict prices for new properties.

---

## Dataset
- Real estate housing dataset
- Contains numerical features related to property and area
- Data preprocessing applied to handle missing values and scaling

---

## Approach
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Clean and preprocess the data  
3. Perform feature engineering  
4. Train multiple regression models  
5. Evaluate models using error metrics  
6. Select the best-performing model  

---

## Models Used
- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  

Random Forest provided better accuracy compared to other models.

---

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Cross-Validation Score

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---
## Results
The final machine learning model predicts house prices with reasonable accuracy and demonstrates a practical application of machine learning techniques in real estate analysis.
